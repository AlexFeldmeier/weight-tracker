## Description

This organizes weights by date using live data showing the latest at the top.

## Getting Started

This app should run like a normal flutter app as I have checked in
all the generated code. Be sure to run `flutter pub get` to get
all the dependencies.

## Notes

Not tested on iOS as I do not have a Mac.
